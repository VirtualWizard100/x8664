1. Starting at address 400575: The argc pointer/rsi gets moved into rax			mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
2. 8 gets added to the rax pointer, making it the argv[1] pointer			add rax, 0x8
3. The value in the rax pointer (the environment variable name) gets loaded into rax	mov rax, QWORD PTR [rax]
4. The value in rax gets moved into rdi(which is the environment variable name)		mov rdi, rdx
5. The getenv function gets called							call 400430 <getenv@plt>
6. The return value of getenv is a pointer to the environment string of the environment mov rsi, rax 
   variable which was put into rax, which is then moved from rax into rsi as the third
   arguement in the printf function
7. rax becomes equal to the argc pointer again						mov rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
8. 8 gets added into rax making it the pointer to the new argv[1] environment variable  add rax, 0x8
   string from the getenv(argv[1]) function					
9. the value of the environment variable string get loaded into rax			mov rax, QWORD PTR [rax]
10.The environment variable string gets moved into rsi, making it the second arguement  mov rsi, rax
   in the printf function
11.The 32 bit environment variable name gets moved back into rdi, making it the first   mov edi, 0x400634
   arguement in the printf function
12.Clear the eax register								mov eax, 0x0
13.Call the printf function to print out the string					call 400440 <printf@plt>
14.Clear the return value of the printf function					mov eax, 0x0
